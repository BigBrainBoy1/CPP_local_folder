I warmly welcome everyone to Aryabhatta College. Our college is a co-educational institution, founded in 1973, and formerly functional as Ram Lal Anand
College (Evening). Adjacent to the South campus of the University of Delhi, we are located against the scenic backdrop of the Aravalli Range.

We at Aryabhatta, in addition to our focus on providing quality education at the undergraduate level, stand for inclusive growth and believe in providing
ample opportunities to our students to assist them in discovering their potential appropriately. As a value-based institution we are dedicated towards
inculcating, in all our students, a desire to evolve into responsible social beings.


Since its inception, I have witnessed an abundance of talent at Aryabhatta. We believe in nurturing the natural strengths of every student in their area of
interest. The souvenirs in hand and success stories of our young achievers are proof of this. We are proud of these achievers and hope to see many more
being awarded in the future.

Mahatma Gandhi said, "Education is all round development of the personality." In the same spirit, after the constructive leadership of my predecessors
and the diligence of my teaching faculty, I am committed towards the facilitation of holistic learning to all our students.

I extend my best wishes to all the new students joining us this academic session. I am confident that our students will wisely make use of every
opportunity available to them.

Prof. Manoj Sinha
Principal
